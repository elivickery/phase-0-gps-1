# Reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?: I wasn't totally clear on the process of making pull requests and merging branches.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?: All of those concepts..thanks! They definitely make sense now.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?: I asked a few questions about the difference between git fetch/merge and git pull.
* What still confuses you about Git?: I'm sure there are other things I don't know yet, but I feel pretty confident in the concepts we've learned so far.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?: It was great! I've pair programmed before, but not via Google Hangouts, so I was a little apprehensive, but Helin and Dayne were awesome and very helpful.
